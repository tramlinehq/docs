### Linear and Jira integrations for Project Management

Tramline now supports [Linear](https://linear.app/) as a project management integration in addition to [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), expanding the platform's ability to connect with project management tools. This integration provides the foundation for tracking project tickets and linking them to releases.

The project management integrations currently allow for configuration of workspace, issue statuses and release labels (or fix versions).

While this initial implementation focuses on connection and configuration, future updates will expand Linear and Jira support to include automatic issue tracking and linking within releases.

### Enhanced GitLab support

GitLab integration has been significantly improved with added support for GitLab CI/CD and making the VCS integration up to date with the updated features. Key improvements include:

**GitLab Pipelines Support**: Full integration with GitLab's CI/CD pipeline system

**Artifact Processing**: Improved artifact downloading and filtering with optional pattern matching

**Better Error Handling**: More granular error reporting for workflow triggers and pipeline failures

**Cherry-pick PRs**: Ability to cherry-pick commits from the release branch to the working branch

This brings GitLab integration to feature parity with other supported CI/CD platforms like GitHub Actions and Bitrise.
