# App Draft Mode

Users shipping brand new apps to Play Store for the very first time often face issues releasing to public channels. This is because the Play Store requires one to make an initial deploy manually before using the APIs.

To avoid having the releases fail late after everything is set up, Tramline detect apps that are in Draft mode on the Play Store and disallow making new releases to public tracks until a manual public release is made from the Play Console.
