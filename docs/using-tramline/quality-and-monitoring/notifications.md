Not everyone in your team is the correct audience for all release-related notifications. Tramline allows you to configure which notifications you want, and what all channels do they need to go in the **Notification Settings** tab for each of your **Release Settings**.

If you feel that your team doesn't require any notifications, as everyone is already informed through Tramline, you can deactivate all notifications in the **Release Settings** tab.
