# ðŸ¤– Automation Overview

export const ReleaseBranch = ({name, n}) => {
    function date() {
        const today = new Date()
        const year = today.getFullYear()
        let month = today.getMonth() + 1
        let day = today.getDate()
        if (month < 10) {
            month = '0' + month
        }
        if (day < 10) {
            day = '0' + day
        }
        return `${year}-${month}-${day}`
    }
    return (<code>r/{name}/{date()}{n ? '-1' : ''}</code>)
};

Tramline automates away a lot of boilerplate work and opines on some sensible defaults. We will continue to add more automations and hopefully also add controls to chose which ones to run.

This is a list of important things tramline currently automatically does with little to no user intervention.

### Cutting a release branch

On starting a new release, we automatically cut a release branch from the specified working branch for the repo.

This is always in the form of `r/name-of-release-train/date-of-release`.

For example, if your release train is called **Nightly**, the release branch will be <ReleaseBranch name="nightly" n=''/>. Additional releases during the day will be <ReleaseBranch name="nightly" n='1'/>.

The release will listen to commits on this branch after it has been created.

### Cutting a release tag at the end of a release

Once the release is finalized, we automatically tag the last commit that was released with the version generated by the release train. If the released version is `1.0.0`. The tag will be `v1.0.0`.

If you're using the GitHub integration for source control, we will also create a [GitHub release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository) with an auto-generated changelog.

### Creating and merging pull requests

We wholly manage pull requests around release branches while starting and ending a release (depending on the branching strategy selected).

See [Branching Strategy](https://www.google.com) for more information.

### Managing version names and build numbers

##### Build number

Every app that is added to tramline maintains an atomic counter for the build number. Regardless of what trains are running for the app, every workflow run will internally and externally update the build number for the generated build.

This ensures that every build generated by tramline across configured workflows always have a unique value.

##### Version Name

Version names are processed in a `major.minor.patch` format. Every new release increments the `minor` version. Every new commit in a release branch, increments the `patch` version.

###### New release

```
1.0.0 --> 1.1.0
```

###### New commit on 1.1.0

```
1.1.0 --> 1.1.1
```

This mechanism is implemented with the assistance of a small CI snippet described [here](https://www.google.com).

### Triggering step workflows on commits

When you start a release or when you land commits on a release branch; we automatically run the steps and their workflows and send the builds generated from the workflows to the correct build channels.

This ensures that all the users and stakeholders of all the relevant build channels are kept up-to-date on new changes without requiring manually sharing builds around. This is especially handy when the app is being QA'd (internally or externally) via the review steps.

### Patching up metadata on App Store
