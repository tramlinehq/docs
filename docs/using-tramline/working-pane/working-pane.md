When you start a new release, this page is your work pane. Everything about the current release is controlled from right here. You will likely spend most of your time in Tramline here.

This is what a typical successful release in Tramline looks like:

The work pane is auto-structured into four main sections:

1. *Kickoff*: Overview, changeset tracking and the homepage for the Release Captain.
2. *Stability*: Internal builds, Release Candidates, testing (coming soon).
3. *Metadata*: Dedicated space for updating notes, store metadata.
4. *Store Release*: Managing reviews and rolling out to production.

The tabs are alive — they always track the current state of that section — whether it's in progress, completed or pending. They also automatically get switched over to the most important tab in the current release.
