NOTE: just a dump of old content from CI/CD page to here

Tramline currently works on the following setup:

```
A single step --> configures a single CI workflow --> expects a single output build
```

By default, we pick up the largest build generated from your CI workflow. But you can override this behavior by specifying a file pattern in the Step configuration.

![](/img/build-artifact-name.png)

For an example on GitHub actions, if you have a bunch of generated artifacts.

![](/img/github-artifacts.png)

This setting will do a substring match for `tramline-release` and ignore the rest.
