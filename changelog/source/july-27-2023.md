### üóíÔ∏è Live release now has a changelog since the last release

![](../../static/img/changelog/changes-since-last.png)

- Release suffixes are now optional for steps
- We now fetch latest build numbers from stores to reduce probability of version clashes
- All non-production deployments are now triggered automatically to allow fully automated releases (this paves way for automatic scheduled releases!)
- Previous runs are cancelled (both in Tramline and in CI) when new commits land
- Commits since the last build in a release are now available as test notes in Slack, FAD and TestFlight
- Improved Slack notifications
