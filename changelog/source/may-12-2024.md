### Introducing Reldex (release process index) 📊

We are excited to introduce Reldex, a new metric and scoring mechanism that helps you understand the efficacy of your release process.

It combines various signals like release duration, hotfixes, time taken to rollout, and fixes during stabilization to give you a single score (between 0 and 1) that represents an overall quality of the delivery process.

This is different from the post-release [monitoring of the health](/changelog/april-22-2024#release-health-rules-and-alerts) of a release based on signals from APM and monitoring tools. Reldex measures everything before or during delivery, rather than the stuff after the release has been rolled out.

Reldex is enabled by default and available to all users, both free and paid. You should already be seeing this score show up on your dashboard. It comes pre-configured with some sensible defaults, but you can fine-tune it based on how you want to weigh and prioritize the importance of each of the signals. Read more about Reldex → [here](https://docs.tramline.app/reldex).

### Allow continuous scheduling despite previous failures 🚲

<p>
  <img src="/img/changelog/auto-stop-scheduled-release.png" width="400"/>
</p>

Tramline currently halts the scheduling of an automatic train if the last release failed, but was not explicitly stopped. This is a safety mechanism to prevent a series of failures.

With the new option of **Automatic stop on failure** under scheduled releases, Tramline will automatically stop a failed release so that a new one can be scheduled and kicked off. This is useful when you're confident that the failure was a one-off and/or you don't want to handhold scheduled releases.

### Less noise when generating automatic tester notes 🎧

When generating automatic commit-based tester notes, we now only consider the first parent when encountering a merge commit. Since Tramline doesn't actually checkout code, we manually [simulate](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#Documentation/git-log.txt---first-parent) `git log [range] --first-parent` to get the correct set of commits needed to generate the appropriate notes.

<details open>
<summary>Improvements and Fixes</summary>

- Auto-populate release notes from previous release for a new release
- Add a note about Slack file upload requiring Tramline to be invited to channel
- Ensure that GitHub integration exists with a mandatory `installation_id`
- Show the last 15 releases on the team page instead of 10
- Add checks for duplicate-actions for all phased rollout related triggers
