- Automatically finish the release when the release step is successful.
- Do not bump up patch version for every commit. Only do so for hotfixes, i.e. commits that are landed during a production rollout.
- A quick wizard to guide you through your first train + step creation process.
- Show details about your integration in the integrations page (bundle id, connection info, project info etc.).
- Create PRs at the end of almost trunk branching strategy to merge from release branch into working branch.
- Add an option to manually refresh Slack channels, incase the list is stale.
- Allow partial semver versioning scheme like MAJOR.MINOR along with MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.
