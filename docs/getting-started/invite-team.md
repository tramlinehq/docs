# Invite your team

Invite your team members to join the Tramline workspace so they can collaborate on the releases with you.

If you have enabled [SSO](/inviting-team/sso), any member of your organization can login via SSO to join Tramline as a viewer without an invitation.

If you have not enabled SSO, you will need to invite your team members to join the Tramline workspace.

Your team members can run releases, approve or reject builds, request changes in the release, or simply follow the progress of the release, view release history, and much more.

For more details on teams and memberships, see [Teams](/inviting-team) page.
