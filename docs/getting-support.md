# ☎️ Getting Support

## Customers

If you're a customer — in trial or paid — you can use one of the following support options:

- Use the support chat inside Tramline itself. Check the bottom right corner of your screen, for the blue colored button:

- Use the priority support Slack channel that your team shares with us. If you're not part of it, ask your team owner to add you.

- Drop us an email at support@tramline.app.

## Open Source Community

- Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/u7VwyvBV2Z) and talk to us on the `#general` channel.
