This repo exists as a meta-repo for all other tramline projects on Github. All ready to medium-ready documentation goes here. Keep links to services and any tramline-relevant documentation aggregated directly from this README.

## Getting started

1. Unstructured notes with a helpful sidebar sit in this [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/tarmac/page/lBTiwRnXX) graph.

## Format

Please stick to using markdown and/or org-mode only.
