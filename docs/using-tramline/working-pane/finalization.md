Once the build has been successfully distributed to all channels in the release step, you can finalize your release. This would typically tag the correct release commit, and depending on the branching strategy, it will also automatically create and merge necessary pull requests.

Once a release is finalized, it becomes locked and is unable to accept any further patches or commits.
