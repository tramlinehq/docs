You can update release-related metadata prior to initiating your production store release. These details can be modified anytime between the beginning of the release and the commencement of a production deployment, as the metadata will be uploaded to the store during the production deployment process.

- Release notes
- Promotional text (**iOS** only)

Tramline will add some sensible defaults for these for your benefit.

### Draft notes

If your release notes or other text updates (such as iOS promo text) don’t meet the validation requirements (like length or formatting), they’ll be saved as a draft instead. You can re-apply the draft, edit and save them needed, but only the most recent invalid draft is kept.
