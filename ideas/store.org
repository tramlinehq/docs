* App Stores
** About
   - We're primarily targeting Google Play Store, but Apple also has an App Store
   - These are global package distribution platforms, that monopolize (duo-polize) the mobile app markets.
   - There are other stores that exist, but are less well known.
   - Most apps are published on these and hence are limited by the level of control these stores publicly provide.
** Usefulness
   - Single market place to publish all apps, makes it easier for end users.
   - All the other generic benefits of an app store.
** Downsides
   - App stores control how apps are pushed, released and updated.
   - App stores do not (currently) provide a mechanism to rollback an app release.
   - App stores do not treat Releases as a first-class atomic entity yet. They are just a bunch of tools to help augment a release.
   - Tramline would have to rely on public APIs provided by these stores and comply with all their updates.
