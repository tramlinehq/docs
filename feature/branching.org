* Release Branches
** About
  - Release branches mark a feature-freeze (a proposed changeset, not a code-freeze) and signify the end-of-line for a particular deployment.
  - They are named generally in some version of the following styles: ~release-{version}~, ~rel-{date/time}~. These names should be time or lexographically sortable.
** Usefuleness
  - In mobile releases, delivery cycles can be longer (a few weeks to months) and hence branching out can be sensible.
    - Hotfixes can be deployed on to the proposed changeset after soak period.
    - Release branches also avoid code-freezing the mainline due to any defects or bugs found during soak.
** Downsides
  - If we're practicing true continous releasing and feature-flagging, then release branches aren't quite necessary.
    - Since one will rely heavily on feature-flagging, automated (and fast) testing and QA.
    - Hotfixes will simply land on the mainline and no code-freezes will purportedly ever happen.
