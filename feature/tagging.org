* Release Tagging
** About
   - Release tags mark the exact commit that can ship to users.
   - They can be named generally in some version of the following: ~v-{build-version}~, ~v-{release-branch}-{build-version}~. These names should be lexographically sortable.
   - They can co-exist with [[./branching.org][Release Branches]]. That is, the commit that was tagged can also be the release branch itself.
   - Tags should be applied to the commit "transactionally" against artifact building step, eg. tag after the build is pushed to store or slack or other channels.
** Usefulness
   - Since a release tag only represents a potential well-known build, there can be multiple release tags which can allow one to track all the fixes for a particular changeset of features.
** Downsides
   - No obvious downsides tagging your release commits. You should!
