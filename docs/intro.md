# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Tramline is a release coordination and deployment platform, designed especially for mobile app teams.

- It **reduces the manual effort** involved in running release cycles for app.
- It **improves visibility** into the release process, even for non-technical stakeholders.
- It **reduces context switching** by supporting iOS and Android apps from a single place.
- It **increases confidence** in releases by letting teams codify their release policy in a release train.
- It **saves time** for teams by automating tasks â€” big and small â€” across the release process.
- It **adds auditability** to releases by centralizing sign-offs and approvals.

Tramline is a **central dashboard** for the mobile DevOps process: it brings together build servers and distribution channels and notifications and approvals in one single place. It goes beyond app releases by including release analytics, build storage, post-release monitoring, and more.
