# Configuring Apps

Set up all the necessary integrations for your app. See the [integrations section](/integrations) for details.

After the integrations are setup, you can configure the following settings for your app.

- **Repository**: choose from the list of repositories you have connected via your [VCS integration](/integrations/version-control)
- **Notifications**: choose from the list of channels you have available via your [Notification integration](/integrations/notifications)

You can click on the __Configure__ button in the top-right of your app page to get to the app configuration.
