Tramline supports App Variants which are akin to product flavors or build variants, but with an explicit requirement of having a different bundle identifier.

For example, you can have a staging variant `com.tramline.ueno.staging` which is different from your primary `com.tramline.ueno` app.

App variants allow you to configure different build distribution endpoints for each of these variants. Eg. different Firebase App Distribution apps for different variants.

When defining a release step, you can now choose the app variant (default being the primary app) and its configuration to be used for the build generation and distribution.
