# Lead Engineer at Tramline

You will be joining as a Lead Engineer at [Tramline](https://tramline.app), and be responsible for everything on the technical side of things. You will work with the founding team on a daily basis, discuss new features, changes and improvements, new hiring, and full financial transparency!

:::note

This is a remote position and you'll be joining as a full-time contractor. We're primarily looking at candidates from India, but we're open to timezones within +/-4 hours of India.

## What is Tramline?

Tramline is a DevOps platform for mobile apps that lets you codify, coordinate, and automate your entire app release process. Tramline is already used by industry-leading fintech mobile teams like [Groww](https://groww.in/), OTT platforms like [Stage](https://www.stage.in), and big banks in SEA to ship their apps.

### Who are we?

Hi! We’re a [small but strong team](https://www.tramline.app/about) of 3 co-founders: Akshay, Pratul, and Nivedita. Tramline is officially setup in the US, but all of us remote and work out of Bangalore. Our backend and frontend are entirely open-source and written in Ruby on Rails. Other, back-facing parts of our stack contain Go, Rust, and Node.js.

Tramline is new, but revenue-making (we cover about 50% of our operational expenses from the revenue). We are funded and supported by prominent [engineering leaders and founders](https://www.tramline.app/about) from the industry.

### Do you *want* to help build a startup?

* If you do not want ambiguity or surprises, this role is not for you. We’re early-stage, and the journey is only going to be uphill. Expect things to be difficult and change unexpectedly.
* You’ll be the one finding answers, watch those answers become redundant at some point, and then find new answers! You want ownership, in spirit and reality.
* We will be globally remote, ergo you document everything and over-communicate.
* You love and favor simplicity over perfection. You know there is no perfection, only context.

### Your first 90 days

* Ideating and building features to serve our existing customers and help us onboard new ones
* Add new integrations and helping make Tramline more reliable and fault-tolerant
* Design the product, do lots of thinking and exploring, and play around with some wild ideas!

### What we’re looking for

:::note

The current architecture is a Ruby on Rails monolith that does all the lifting. This architecture is expected to continue in the near future, unless ecosystem / scale / maintenance requirements evolve.

:::


We’re looking for someone who →

* has 3+ years of total experience
* has 1+ years of experience writing Ruby & Rails
* understands Rails conventions and design principles (service objects, decorators, etc.)
* understands ActiveRecord, indexes, and caching well
* has launched and maintained production Rails apps
* has experience designing job orchestrators (through Sidekiq or otherwise)
* embraces testing and continuous integration
* can write simple JS and UI flows (stimulus/hotwire preferred) that power dashboards and reports

## Pay and benefits

* Cash: USD 25k–30k (₹21-25 lac INR) per annum
* Equity: 0.5–1%, 4 year vesting period including a 1-year cliff
* We are open to adjusting the cash and equity proportions
* We'll cover the basics: workstation enhancements, co-working passes, software licenses you need, etc.

:::note

If there's anything else we can do to make your work more enjoyable, just ask, we'll try.

## How to Apply

Email **hiring@tramline.app**, with your answers to these four questions:

1. We don't care for resumes, but we are interested in what you’ve done in the past. Tell us your story the way you prefer it.
2. What is the best book you've read recently? What's the best book you've *ever* read? (If you can answer both questions, once for technical books and once for explicitly non-technical books, that would be great.)
3. What is your go-to resource(s) for solving programming problems?
4. Who do you look up to in the industry? Why?
