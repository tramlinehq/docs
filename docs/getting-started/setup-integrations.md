# Set up integrations

You need a set of core intgerations to get started with your releases in Tramline.

1. VCS (Version Control System)
2. Build Servers (CI/CD)
3. Build Distribution

The remaining integrations are optional and can be added later.

A detailed integration guide is available [here](/docs/integrations/overview).
