# ðŸ’° Checks & Balances

- what is the correct build? (for qa)
- blocking production
  - approvals
  - upcoming release
  - another hotfix in progress
  - rc has not been created
- release finish constraints
- release start constraints
- lock the release branch
- ensure workflow passes before build is submitted
- human errors:
  - commit from internal is promoted to rc
  - ensure everything is merged before completing a release
