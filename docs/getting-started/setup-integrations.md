# Set up integrations

You need a set of core integrations to get started with your releases in Tramline.

1. [VCS (Version Control System)](/integrations/version-control/)
2. [Build Servers (CI/CD)](/integrations/ci-cd/)
3. [Build Distribution](/integrations/distribution/)

The remaining integrations are optional and can be added later as per your requirements. A detailed integration guide is available [here](/integrations/).

Once the integrations are set up and configured, you can start creating your first release.
