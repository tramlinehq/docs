# Changeset Tracking

There is one dedicated page to track all the commits, PRs and changes going into the release.
There are five sections to this page:

1. **Changes since last release** - all the commits since the last completed release (ongoing in case of upcoming release).
2. **Ongoing work** - The all PRs open against your release branch.
3. **Change queue** - All the changes that have not yet been applied to the release.
4. **Latest applied commits** - The changes that have been applied to the release and a build has been generated that includes all of them.
5. **Pending backmerges** - Continuous backmerge PRs for each of the release branch changes that are not yet merged to the working branch.

There is a flow of change from Ongoing work ➡ Change queue ➡ Latest applied commits.
