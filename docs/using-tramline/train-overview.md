### Team Contributions

Tramline, now supports adding your organization's team structure to the platform. This opens up a lot of possibility around correlating team performance metrics with release dynamics.

We're kicking things off with release stability & contribution analysis across teams.

What, or rather, who is holding up your releases? We break down which team has contributed the most to the stability of releases.

The flip side of this analysis is equally interesting. Instead of who is holding things up, you get rough indicators on who is contributing the most to a release.

Since this data is also available in real-time for ongoing releases, it complements the insights provided in the Ongoing Work section. Release captains now get a pretty good sense of what (and who) is holding up the release from moving ahead.
