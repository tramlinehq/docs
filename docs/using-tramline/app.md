# Add your app

To kick things off, add your app.

![](/img/create-new-app.png)

The bundle identifier is the [Application ID](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/configure-app-module#set-application-id) in android, and the [Bundle ID](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/bundle_ids) on iOS.

You can add multiple apps to Tramline as long the bundle identifiers are unique. It is possible to add apps for the Android and iOS platform with the same bundle identifier.

The **build number** is just the initial version code you'd like to use to start off releases. After this, all increments are managed by Tramline. You can pick the starting number to be a few increments past your last released value.

Once the app is saved and validated, the next step is to configure release trains.
