## Customers

If you're a customer — in trial or paid — you can always drop us an email at support@tramline.app. For priority support, there are two options:

#### In-app chat

Use the support chat inside Tramline itself. Check the bottom right corner of your screen, for the blue colored button. The chat bubble will show our typical response times.

#### Shared Slack channel

Ping on the Slack channel that your team shares with us. If you're not part of it, ask your team owner to add you. This is the fastest way to reach out to us.

## Open Source

- Join our [Discord server](https://go.tramline.app/discord) and talk to us on the `#general` channel.
- Create a new issue in our [GitHub issue queue](https://github.com/tramlinehq/tramline/issues).
